Dear Narragansett Bay Commission,

This morning I arrived to drop my kids off at the Paul Cuffee Lower School on Promenade Street at 8am. I was greeted by four tractor trailers standing with flashers on that had completely parked in the school. The only available space for cars dropping off children was in the turning lane from Pleasant Valley Parkway onto Promenade. After working my way around the trucks, I asked the detail police officer if he could move them out of the way. His response was to blame the school buses for blocking access to Rathbone.

In the moment of this morning's situation, I think the truck drivers were probably doing the best they could. And it's true that the buses were blocking access to Rathbone. But here's the thing. You scheduled four giant trucks to arrive all at once at the absolute peak traffic time for this school. A school that you have been operating next to for well over a year. This should not have been a surprise. The cop's claim that if the school would just let the kids out it would all be fine displays an ignorance of the environment. The buses are unloaded (every day) in an orderly and controlled pace so that the kids enter the school without huge bottle-necks. They are headed to the cafeteria for breakfast. Dumping them all into the school at once would create a huge line that would literally extend out the door. The school cannot open the doors early and should not turn the kids out onto the street on a cold (or any other) morning. It takes time to do this right and they've thought about the system a lot. I believe the same pacing probably exists for your trucks. I highly doubt that you can load material into all four trucks simultaneously. So you know they are going to need a place to be for, what two hours? More?

And this is the reason I'm writing. A reasonably intelligent bystander might be surprised by this kind of problem and its complexity. But you should clearly not be. You are managing [a huge project](http://www.narrabay.com/ProgramsAndProjects/Combined%20Sewer%20Overflow%20Project.aspx) that requires complex systems thinking. This kind of screw-up is a rookie move for an organization like yours. It appears to be the product of a willful disregard for your neighbor, and it's part of a pattern. The elementary school has been dealing with a wide variety of issues realted to your product: Trash and dust, rude and inconsiderate construction workers, a giant and deafening exhaust fan pointed at our outdoor play space.

Your site is not a bubble isolated from its environment. It exists in a tight space with several neighbors and you need to be more proactive in heading this sort of thing off, not just apologizing after the fact.
