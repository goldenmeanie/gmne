Fever dream:

Is the rational response to learning a SECRET maximally dispersing it as quickly as possible? If you come into possesion of some potentially embarassing information, which is more probable that the circle of trust is expanded to include you, or you are discredited or in some other scarier way eliminated as a threat?

It sounds like a movie plot. The very human response to sweep mistakes and wrongdoing under the carpet to avoid embarassment combines with big impact to make the elimination of the leak the most preferred (cheapest) option.

The current trend towards citizens being required to submit to more and more losses of privacy in the name of security. Has lead to even more of an imbalance in information.
