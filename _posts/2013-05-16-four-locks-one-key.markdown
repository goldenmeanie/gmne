Should I ride? The main obstacle I usually face is just, “ugh”. This might be about the actual ride, but usually it’s about all the things I have to think about beforehand. There are a few different parts to this but today I’ll talk about locks.

## One key to bind them
I have four identically keyed u-locks. This sounds like a simple thing (it is if you are buying new locks) but it has two huge advantages. One, I only have one bike lock key on my keychain. Two, when riding with a group we just grab one lock for each bike and any rider can open any of the locks. This takes one more seemingly simple but persistent logistical hurdle out of the analysis that you run each time you ask yourself “should I ride?”

Kryptonite will send you however many locks you request set to one key. the only caveat is that they all have to use the same size tumbler. So, for example, I got four pocket locks instead of three pocket and one longer shackle model. My [local bike shop](http://legendbicycles.com "Legend Bicycles") ordered them for me originally and helped me replace one that didn’t return from a night ride. It was painless and I don’t recall it costing any more than buying one off the shelf.
