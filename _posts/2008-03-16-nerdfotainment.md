Nerdfotainment (Sunday, March 16, 2008 2:14:00 PM


Today I came across the [Nerdfotainment](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/03/11/nerdfotainment.html) post at [Rands in Repose](http://www.randsinrepose.com).

The premise of this post, like the really excellent [Handbook](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html) post, is that nerds love and in fact _need_ puzzles and projects. Provide them as in Lost, Donnie Darko, etc. or we’ll create them ourselves as in endless debate about the original Star Trek. I get that. In fact I cannot watch shows like Lost live in their season, I have to do it on DVD because I can’t hack the week breaks between fixes. But, I just plain don’t watch Lost anymore. Because in the third season I got the feeling that there was no plan. They’re just making this shit up as they go along. Abrams more or less said this in his [Mystery Box Talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/205) at Ted. The mystery is more powerful, and I believe easier to pull off, than the answer. And that, to me, is a _nerd trap_. It’s a funneling of that problem-solving energy into nothing. There’s no there, there. It’s just providing ad breaks for (in the case of Lost) the next three years.
