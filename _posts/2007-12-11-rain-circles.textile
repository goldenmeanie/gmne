The weather has been wacky lately (cold-warm-cold-warm) and has coated the trees with a film of ice. Yesterday had just the right temperature and wind mix to dry up the groundwater but leave the tree ice intact.

So today when it got warm, every tree in the neighborhood made its own little rainstorm. The drops of water and ice were brilliant in the afternoon sun and made a circle of wet ground under their canopies. Beautiful!
